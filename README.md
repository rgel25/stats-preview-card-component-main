## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
This is a simple web application showcasing my command of HTML and CSS.

## The challenge

This is one of the challenges that makes me wish I had the design's exact measurements for the elements. It was really hard to eyeball these measurement since the elements
in the layouts and their corresponding spacings varies from each other.

## My solution

I started the challenge by creating two cards on top of each other with the mobile design in mind. The layout in this part is pretty simple. On the bigger screens,
I combined these two cards into a single main card by using display flex and media query. I didn't have the exact measurements so I eyeballed the layout which is the hardest
part of this challenge. Having said that, I settled with the measurements that I think is appropriate to the screen size.
